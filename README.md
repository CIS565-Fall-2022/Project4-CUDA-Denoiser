# Overview
This project is a CUDA-based pathtracing denoiser that uses geometry buffers (G-buffers) to guide a smoothing filter. It is based on the paper "Edge-Avoiding A-Trous Wavelet Transform for fast Global Illumination Filtering" and it helps produce a smoother appearance in a pathtraced image with fewer samples-per-pixel.

# <a name="performance">Performance Analysis</a>
* How much time denoising adds to the renders
* how denoising influences the number of iterations needed to get an "acceptably smooth" result
* how denoising at different resolutions impacts runtime
* how varying filter sizes affect performance
* how visual results vary with filter size -- does the visual quality scale uniformly with filter size?
* how effective/ineffective is this method with different material types
* how do results compare across different scenes - for example, between `cornell.txt` and `cornell_ceiling_light.txt`. Does one scene produce better denoised results? Why or why not?
* A-Trous vs. Gaussian Filtering
