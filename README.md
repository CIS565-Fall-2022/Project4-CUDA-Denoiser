CUDA Denoiser For CUDA Path Tracer
==================================

**University of Pennsylvania, CIS 565: GPU Programming and Architecture, Project 4**

* XiaoyuDu
* Tested on: Windows 10, i9-11900KF @ 3.50GHz, RTX 3080 (Personal PC)

  
### Description  
This project built a denoiser based on an GPU-based path tracer. The algorithm of the denoiser follows the mthods proposed in the paper "Edge-Avoiding Ã€-Trous Wavelet Transform for fast Global Illumination Filtering" by Holger Dammertz, Daniel Sewtz, Johannes Hanika, Hendrik P.A. Lensch. 
  
  
### Feature  
* I implemented all the features for part 1.  


### Analysis  
* Runtime for Denoiser  
I tested the denoiser with 10 iterations of the cornell box scene. Averagely speaking, after adding the denoiser, the runtime for each iteration increased for about 1.11242ms.  
* Influence on the number of iterations  
I tested the influence of denoiser with filter size of 20, color weight of 12, normal weight of 0.02, and position weight of 0.34. The results are shown below. As you can see, originally, we need around 500 iterations to get an "acceptably smooth" result. With this denoiser, only around 60 iterations are needed to get an "acceptably smooth" result.  

|  Denoiser on | Denoiser off |
| ----------------- | ----------------- |
| 1 iteration | 30 iterations |

| 60 iterations | 500 iterations |

* Impact of Different Resolutions on Runtime  
Below is a chart that compare the runtime with different resolutions. The runtime are counted in millisecond for 50 iterations. The resolution are tested from 1000x1000 to 2500x2500. Note, the increase in resolutions is not linear, so the increase in the difference of runtime is also not linear. However, we can notice from the overall trends that the runtime increase should be linear with respect to number pixels.

* Impact of filter sizes on Runtime  
The impact of filter sizes on runtime are tested with a resolution of 1000x1000 and iterations of 50. The runtime are counted in millisecond for 50 iterations. The filter size are tested from 10x10 to 80x80. I am expecting the runtime increase as filter size increase. The result generally shows this trends and also a linear relationship with respect to the filter size.

* Impact of filter sizes on Image  
Generally speaking, the image quality will increase as the filter size increase. In the example below, I tested the impact of different filter sizes with 10 iterations, color weight of 3.9, normal weight of 0.01, position weight of 0.025. As shown in the result, the quality of image looks better with higher filter size. When the filter size is above 40, I can't see the difference between the images I got anymore.

|  FilterSize = 10 | FilterSize = 20 | FilterSize = 40 |
